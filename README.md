# Constellation Delphinus

*Constellation* is a flexible many-to-many remote control project, aiming for a funtionality similar to that of macro keyboards over network. 
*Delphinus* is a baseline *Action Server* implementation that is being used to develop a proof of concept, and will *hopefully* be used to implement bridge for 3rd party APIs.


**Current State:** Initial Protocol Development

It uses [CoatyJS](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-js) and Mqtt for communication.
